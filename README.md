# Keep-Rollin(Goup Project for csci 526)

## Brief Description
We want to develop a puzzle game like "Waterfull" and the "Cut the Rope". A ball will start rolling from the start point of the line. With a limited budget of line provided, the player needs to draw lines or use different items to change the track of the ball to reach the destination (hole) and collect as many stars as possible.
